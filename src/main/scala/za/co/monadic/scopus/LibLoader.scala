/**
 * General loader for dynamic libraries from the resources directory in the jar file.
 * It copies the required library from the jar to the target temporary directory and then
 * optionally loads the file using System.load(). It will clean the directory on JVM
 * shutdown using shutdown hooks. It is clever enough to find the correct
 * directory for the native version of the library (although this is untested). Note that
 * you need to build the JNI native stubs with some care so that dependent libraries
 * can be loaded. In Linux for example, Java must load libjni_opus.so (JNI native code).
 * The actual Opus library is loaded by the dynamic linker from a dependency in the stub.
 * Libjni_opus.so is built to look in the same directory for libopus, so we must copy
 * it to a temporary directory as well, but there is no need to ask the JVM to load it.
 * In Windows, you will need to load it as well.
 *
 * Libraries are stored in the resources/native/os.name/os.arch directory and copied
 * to the system temporary directory as indicated by the java.io.tmpdir property plus
 * a random one time directory name with the prefix "scopus_". In Linux, the temporary
 * directory would have a name like "/tmp/scopus_418af7c0b63b/".
